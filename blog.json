Questioning the ecological threats facing the world, Hyber created an in-situ installation around the tree trunks on which the foundations of Venice rest. This reforestation process brings to life an invisible forest, which would have continued to grow through the city's glass - right in the heart of the Espace Louis Vuitton Venezia.",

Virgil was not only a friend, great collaborator, creative genius, visionary and disruptor, but also one of the best cultural communicators of our times. He paved the way for future generations. As a devoted supporter of his community through his charities and passions, he was an eternal optimist who believed anything was possible. In this same spirit, we at Louis Vuitton will proudly continue to celebrate his legacy with a final show in Miami, per his wishes. I am honored to have called him my friend. My deepest thoughts are with his wife, children, parents, family and the entire community that was touched by his greatness -Michael Burke, Louis Vuitton’s Chairman and CEO",
